# Udacity MyReads

This project is an implementation for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

It has a backend server to store books and shelves provided by Udacity. The API methods can be viewed at [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
